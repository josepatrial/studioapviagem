OK. I understand the system is not functioning. Here's a detailed checklist to help you troubleshoot and restore functionality:

**I. Basic Checks**

1.  **Recent Code Changes:**

    *   What specific code changes have been implemented recently?
    *   Try reverting to a previous, stable version of the code to see if that resolves the issue.
2.  **Deployment Status:**

    *   If the app is deployed, confirm the deployment was successful.

**II. Firebase Configuration and Connection**

1.  **API Keys:** Check the API keys
2.  **Firebase Status Dashboard:** Check the Firebase Status Dashboard for any outages or known issues.
3.  **Firebase Authentication:** Ensure Authentication is enabled in the Firebase project and that the sign-in method you are using (e.g., Email/Password) is enabled.

**III. Database (Firestore) Issues**

1.  **Security Rules:**

    *   Go to the "Firestore Database" section in the Firebase Console.
    *   Click the "Rules" tab.
    *   For testing, ensure you have permissive rules to allow authenticated users to read and write.  Remember to secure these rules later!
2.  **Existing Data:** Ensure these collections exists.

**IV. Local Database (IndexedDB) - If Applicable**

1.  **Inspect Data:**

    *   Use browser developer tools to inspect the contents of your IndexedDB database. See if data is being stored correctly.

**V. Code and Logic**

1.  **Review Recent Changes:** Carefully examine any recent code changes, especially in these areas:

    *   Authentication (login, signup, logout)
    *   Data fetching (reading from Firestore or IndexedDB)
    *   Data writing (saving to Firestore or IndexedDB)
2.  **Error Handling:**
   -Check that you have a suitable error handler.

After checking the above, share your results. What did you see and do?
